  - question: Imagine you are using flashcards to study for a foreign language vocabulary test, similar to what you just completed.  When studying each pair of words, one on each side of the flashcard, you have the option to either be presented with the foreign language word and produce the English word (e.g., you first see gato and have to produce cat).  This is the <b>easy</b> direction.  On the other hand, you can be presented with the English word and produce the foreign language word (e.g., you first see cat and have to produce gato).  This is the <b>difficult</b> direction.<br/><br/>Given that you can go through your flashcards 4 times, which of the following study sequences do you think would be the <b>most effective</b> for learning given that you might have to produce both the English word as well as the foreign language word on the test?<br/>
