During this experiment, you will read two passages, take some multiple choice practice tests, followed by a final test. Please try to answer as accurately as possible. You will have nine minutes to read each passage and 30 seconds per question on the practice tests. If you finish reading before the 9 minutes is up, please continue to study the passage. Once you have answered each practice question, use the remaining time to check your answers. The final test will be self-paced.
