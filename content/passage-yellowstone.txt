Established in 1872, Yellowstone became America's first national park. The park is located at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, for which it takes its name. In the eighteenth century, French trappers named the river "Roche Jaune" which is probably a translation of the Minnetaree name for "Rock Yellow River." Approximately 96% of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located in the state of Wyoming, but the park extends into neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Yellowstone is widely known for its wildlife and geothermal features: the park, itself, contains half of the world's geothermal features.

Evidence suggests that Aboriginal peoples have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. The region is home to several Native American tribes including the Nez Perce, Crow, and Shoshone. European explorers first entered the region in the early nineteenth century. In 1806, John Colter left the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the region with a group of fur trappers. Upon seeing Yellowstone, he described it as a place of "fire and brimstone" due to the boiling mud, steaming rivers, and petrified trees. Colter continued to explore the region for another four years, finally leaving the wilderness when two of his partners were killed by Blackfeet Indians. Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of geothermal features of Yellowstone, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth. After an 1856 exploration, mountain man Jim Bridger reported observing boiling springs, sprouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored as Bridger was known for being a "spinner of yarns." His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper Missouri River region. Bridger and United States Army surveyor W. F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the Black Hills region in what is now the state of South Dakota, the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back.

In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill into law that created Yellowstone National Park. Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first Superintendent, serving for five years although denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or to properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. In 1916, pioneering industrialist and conservationist, Stephen Tyng Mather, along with journalist and writer Robert Sterling Yard, spearheaded a publicity campaign to promote the creation of a federal agency to oversee National Parks. Mather eventually became the first director of the National Park Service under the United States Department of the Interior. Under the dynamic leadership of Mather, several national parks, including the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park, were established. In 1917, administration of Yellowstone was transferred to the National Park Service

Yellowstone is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem—a region that includes Grand Teton National Park and adjacent National Forests. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped land in the United States (outside of Alaska) and is considered to be the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone. Yellowstone is home for a variety of animals including elk, moose, and bison: threatened species include the endangered gray wolf, the threatened lynx, and grizzly bears. An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species. Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000— making them the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. Numbering fewer than 50 in 1902, but more than 4,000 as of 2003, bison as also well represented in the park.

Yellowstone National Park spans an area of approximately 3,500 square miles. The park rests at an average altitude of 8,000 feet above sea level. The highest point in the park is atop Eagle Peak, which is almost 11, 400 feet above sea level. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau (although not the highest) is Mount Washburn at 10, 243 feet. Nearby mountain ranges include the Gallatin Range to the northwest, the Beartooth Mountains in the north, the Absaroka Range to the east, and the Teton Range and the Madison Range to the southwest and west.

Forests comprise 80% of the park's land area—the remaining land area is primarily comprised of grasslands. 1.700 species of trees and plants are native to the park. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as the Douglas Fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the Whitebark Pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. Aspen and willow are the most common species of deciduous trees in the park.

Yellowstone National Park sits atop the Yellowstone Caldera, which is considered an active volcano. The most recent volcanic activity occurred about 70,000 years ago. Geothermic activity continues to occur in geysers and other thermal features in the park. There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal feature.A geyser is a type of hot spring that erupts periodically: geyser activity is caused by surface water gradually seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma. The most famous geyser in the park is Old Faithful. The tallest active geyser in the park, as well as in the world, is Steamboat Geyser. Daisy Geyser usually erupts every 90-110 minutes and is very predictable. Castle Geyser is thought to be the oldest geyser in the world. The size of Castle Geyser's cone, in a shape that reminds people of a castle, indicates that it may be somewhere between 5,000 and 40,000 years old. Interestingly, although prominent in the park, geysers are actually the least common geothermal feature there. Besides geysers, Yellowstone has other geothermal features including hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles. A fumarole is an opening the earth's crust that emits steam and gases including carbon dioxide. Hot springs are the most common hydrothermal features in the park. A prominent hot spring known for its beauty is Morning Glory Pool.

Yellowstone is a popular tourist destination. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year.
