During this experiment, you will read two passages, take some initial multiple-choice tests, followed by a final test. You will have 9 minutes to read each passage and 25 seconds per question on the initial tests. If you finish reading before the 9 minutes are up, please continue to study the passage. Once you have answered each initial question, use the remaining time to check your answer. When there are 10 seconds remaining, a timer will appear to let you know you should be selecting an answer soon. After you have answered each question, you will be asked to rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 0 - 100 where 0 means you are NOT at all confident in your answer and 100 is you are completely confident you got the correct answer. The final test will be self-paced.

If you have any questions or experience any issues, please contact the experimenter. Please attempt to answer all questions even if you are unsure.
