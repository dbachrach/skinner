You will have 9 minutes to read each of 2 passages.  The computer will move you on when your reading time is finished.

Before you read each passage, you will be asked a series of questions about the passage topic.  Please answer each question to the best of your ability.  We realize that you might not know the answers, but please make the best educated guess you can.  You will have 25 seconds per question, and the computer will move you on after that time.

Finally, you will take a final test on all of the information that you have learned after reading.
