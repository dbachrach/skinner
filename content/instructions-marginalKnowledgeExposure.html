You will begin by answering a series of questions to test your reaction speed. You will see a letter at the top of your screen with a word beneath. Your job is to determine whether the word <b>BEGINS</b> with the letter you see at the top of the screen as quickly as possible.

For example, you might see:
<pre>
D

Dog
</pre>
Since Dog starts with D, you would press the Y button to say, “Yes, the word begins with the letter shown above it.”

Alternatively, you might see
<pre>
D

Cat
</pre>
Cat does not start with D, so you would press the N button to say, “No, the word does NOT begin with letter shown above it.”

<b>To recap:</b> you will press the Y or N keys to indicate “Yes” or “No” to the question “Does the letter displayed on the top of the screen match the first letter of the word presented?” Please do this as quickly as possible, so we can get an accurate measure of your reaction time.

Once this section of the survey is completed, you will be asked a series of trivia questions. Answer the questions as quickly as you can, as if you were participating in a game show. Do not try too hard to think of the answer if you are unsure, but put in your best guess and move on to the next question. Receiving credit does not depend on how many answers you get correct.
