Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in the Solar System. The planet is most well known for its beautiful system of planetary rings, which consist largely of water ice particles with smaller amounts of rocky debris and dust. Along with Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, Saturn is classified as a gas giant (also known as a Jovian planet, after the planet Jupiter).

The existence of Saturn has been known since prehistoric times: Saturn is the most distant planet that can be seen with the naked eye. Saturn gets its name from the Roman god Saturnus: the god of agriculture and harvest. The Romans considered Saturnus to be the equivalent of the Greek god, Kronos. Ancient Chinese cultures designated the planet Saturn as the 'earth star,' based upon the five elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements. In Hindu astrology, Saturn is known as 'Sani' or "Shani'—the judge among all the planets.

Saturn's rings were first observed by Galileo in 1610. With his telescope, Galileo was able to see Saturn's rings, but was not able to observe them as such, instead declaring Saturn to be composed of three bodies that almost touch each other. It was in 1655 that Christian Huygens was the first to suggest that a ring surrounded Saturn. In 1675, Giovanni Domenico Cassini determined that Saturn's ring was actually composed of multiple smaller rings with gaps between them; the largest of these gaps was later named the Cassini Division. In 1959, James Clerk Maxwell hypothesized that the rings could not be solid or they would become unstable and break apart. Maxwell proposed that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles, all independently orbiting Saturn. Maxwell's theory was proven correct in 1895 through spectroscopic studies of the rings carried out by James Keeler.

Saturn orbits the sun at an average distance of 1.4 billion kilometers. One Saturnian year (the amount of time that it takes Saturn to rotate around the Sun) occurs about every 30 Earth-years. One Saturnian day (the amount of time that it takes the planet to rotate on its axis) takes approximately ten Earth-hours. This can be contrasted with Mercury, which has a relatively fast revolution around the sun and a relative slow rotation on its axis. A day on Mercury (the time it takes the planet to rotate on its axis) takes 176 Earth-days, but a Mercurian year (the time it takes the planet to orbit the sun) takes 88 Earth-days—on Mercury, a day is longer than a year.

Saturn is composed of hydrogen, with small amounts of helium and other trace elements. Although there is little direct information about Saturn's internal structure, it is thought that the interior of the planet consists of a small core of rock and ice, surrounded by a thick layer of metallic hydrogen and a gaseous outer layer. Because of its massive gaseous layer, Saturn has a low density compared to other planets: Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System that has a density less than that of water. Saturn has a planetary magnetic field that is stronger than that of Earth, but not as strong as that of Jupiter. Not every planet has a magnetic field. Venus, for example, is a special case of a rocky planet with no magnetic field.

Sixty known moons orbit Saturn. Only seven of Saturn's known moons are massive enough to have collapsed into hydrostatic equilibrium under their own gravitation. Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the Solar System's second largest moon (only Jupiter's moon, Ganymede is larger). Titan was discovered in 1655 by Huygens. Titan is the only moon in the Solar System to possess a significant atmosphere. Mimas and Enceladus were discovered by William Herschel in 1789. Saturn's celestial body atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are also much wider near the equator.

Saturn's rings, unlike the rings of other planets, are very bright. Evidence suggest that the rings of Saturn possess their own atmosphere, which is independent of the planet itself; this atmosphere is largely made of the oxygen gas (02) that is produced when ultraviolet light from the Sun interacts with ice in the rings. Two prominent rings (A and B) and one faint ring (C) can be seen from Earth. There are several gaps within the rings; two such gaps are opened by known moons embedded within them. The gap between the A and the B rings is known as the Cassini Division. The much fainter gap in the outer part of the A ring is known as the Encke Gap. The Maxwell Gap lies within the outer part of the C ring. The area between the A ring and the F ring is known as the Roche Division. While the largest gaps in the rings (such as the Cassini Division and the Encke Gap) can be seen from Earth, it has been discovered that the rings actually have an intricate structure of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. Additionally, Saturn's second largest moon Rhea may have a fragile ring system of its own. Until 1980, the structure of the rings of Saturn was explained exclusively as the action of gravitational forces. The Voyager spacecraft found radial features in the B ring, called spokes, which could not be explained in this manner, as their persistence and rotation around the rings were not consistent with orbital mechanics. Spokes appear to be a seasonal phenomenon, disappearing in the Saturnian midwinter/midsummer and reappearing as Saturn comes closer to equinox.

Saturn was first visited in September 1979; Pioneer 11 flew within 20,000 km of the planet's cloud tops. In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe visited the Saturn system; the probe revealed previously unseen surface features of various moons. Voyager1 data indicated that wind speeds on Saturn could reach 1,800 km/hour—significantly faster than those on Jupiter. Voyager 2 probed slightly later, in 1981. In 2004, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft conducted a flyby of Titan, capturing radar images of its large lakes and their coastlines as well as numerous islands and mountains. In March of 2006, NASA reported the existence of geysers: liquid water reservoirs that erupt on Saturn's moon Enceladus; pockets of liquid water may exist no more than tens of meters below the surface of the moon. In 2006, a Cassini-Huygens probe saw the first proof of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole: the largest of these is almost the size of the Caspian Sea. The Cassini-Huygens probe's primary mission ended in 2008 when the spacecraft had been expected to have completed 74 orbits around the planet Saturn.
