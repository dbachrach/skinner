Welcome to Part 2

The final portion of the experiment should take approximately 15 minutes.  Do not begin unless you plan to complete everything at once.  Please type in the word that you previously studied that corresponds with definition shown.  If you do not know the answer, please enter your best guess.  You will not be able to leave any answers blank.  You will be allowed to move at your own pace for this portion of the experiment.  Please do NOT look up the definitions in another window during completion of the final test.  Do NOT close the window until told to do so, or else we will not know that you have completed this portion of the experiment.
