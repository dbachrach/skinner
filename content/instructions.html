You are about to study 36 pairs of difficult GRE-level vocabulary words.  Each word will be presented for 5 seconds before automatically moving you on to the next word.  Once all of the words have been studied once, you will see them again (in a new random order) for 5 seconds each.  Please do your best to learn the GRE words and their definition, as you will be tested on them later.
