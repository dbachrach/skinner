You will be studying and tested upon Lithuanian-English word pairs. Please try to study the pairs to maximize your learning as if you were studying for a foreign language course.  As might be the case when studying for a class, you do not know  whether you will be asked to retrieve the English or the Lithuanian words on the final test, so you should try to learn both words of the pair equally well.
