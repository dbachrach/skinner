During this experiment, you will read two passages, take some initial multiple-choice tests, followed by a final test. You will have 9 minutes to read each passage. During the initial tests, you will see a question appear on the screen for 10 seconds, then each of the answer choices will be displayed individually for 5 seconds. Once you have seen all of the answer choices individually, you will see them all at the same time and be given another 5 seconds to select your chosen answer. You will not be able to select an answer until the last 5 seconds and the test will move on automatically, so please pay attention and select your chosen answer quickly once you can.
If you finish reading before the 9 minutes are up, please continue to study the passage. The final test will be self-paced. If you have any questions or experience any issues, please contact the experimenter.
