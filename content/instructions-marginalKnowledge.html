First you will answer a series of multiple-choice trivia questions, followed by a series of fill-in-the-blank questions to test your knowledge of general cultural facts. You will have 12 seconds to select an answer choice on the multiple-choice questions and as much time as you would like on the fill-in-the-blank questions. The final test will be self-paced, but donâ€™t think too hard about any of the answers. Answer as if you were on a trivia show and having to answer rapidly. Please attempt to answer all questions even if your answers are just guesses. This should take no more than 20 minutes of your time.
