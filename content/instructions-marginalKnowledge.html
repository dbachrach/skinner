You will answer a series of fill-in-the-blank questions to test your knowledge of general cultural facts. The test will be self-paced, but donâ€™t think too hard about any of the answers. Answer as if you were on a trivia show and having to answer rapidly. Please attempt to answer all questions even if your answers are just guesses. This should take about 5 minutes of your time.
