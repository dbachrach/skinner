You will be learning GRE vocabulary words. You study the words using digital flashcards. We are interested in how long people need to study flashcards in order to effectively learn, so the words and definitions will be displayed for a predetermined amount of time. If the flashcard displayed on the screen for longer than you would normally study it, please just continue to try to learn the word and its definition.

The final test will be in a similar format to the actual GRE exam where you will be asked to use vocabulary words in the context of sentences. On the final test you will see words as alternatives that you will have not studied (as might actually happen on the actual GRE). Sometimes the correct answer will be one of these non-studied words. Please do your best to complete each and every sentence with the most appropriate word.
