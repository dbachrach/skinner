During this experiment, you will read two passages, play Tetris, review the passages, and then answer questions about the materials you have read. You will have 9 minutes to read each passage. If you finish reading before the 9 minutes are up, please continue to study the passage. After playing Tetris, you will have 4 minutes to review the passages. The final test will be self-paced. Please attempt to answer all questions even if you are unsure.

If you have any questions or experience any issues, please contact the experimenter.
