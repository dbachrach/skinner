You will have 9 minutes to read each of 2 passages.  The computer will move you on when your reading time is finished.

Before you read each passage, you will be asked a series of questions about the passage topic.  The questions will be in format you have likely not seen before.  Instructions for how to answer will be provided below.  Please answer each question to the best of your ability.  We realize that you might not know the answers, but please make the best educated guess you can.  You will have 25 seconds per question, and the computer will move you on after that time.

Finally, you will take a final test on all of the information that you have learned after reading.

The formatting and scoring of the multiple-choice questions may be unfamiliar to you, so you will be walked through how to answers these questions in the next pages. You will learn and practice how to answer questions based on your confidence in the answer. You goal is to maximize your score. The answers are not color-coded. The colors are just meant to illustrate relationships.

Say you have just read a passage about the Canadian Province, British Columbia and are asked the question “What is the capital of British Columbia, Canada?”
You remember the answer is Victoria and are highly confident, so you would mark the bubble beside the answer Victoria and receive 3 points for a correct answer.

However, if you marked the bubble next to Berlin, indicating you are highly confident Berlin is the correct answer, and it is NOT, you would lose 10 points. You would also lose 10 points if you completely ruled out Victoria and selected a circle in between Vancouver and Berlin.

Say you are easily able to eliminate Berlin as an incorrect answer since you know Berlin is in Germany, not Canada, but know that Victoria and Vancouver are both in British Columbia and cannot remember which is the capital. You are not highly confident in either answer, so you would mark one of the bubbles along the line between Victoria and Vancouver. If each answer is equally attractive to you, you would mark the bubble directly in the middle and gain only 1 correct point.

If you pick the bubble closer to the correct answer, Victoria, indicating you think that Victoria answer is more likely correct, you would earn 2 points towards your score.

If you pick the bubble closer to the incorrect answer, Vancouver, you would lose 1 point.

If you are completely unsure of the answer, you can mark “Don’t Know” in the center of the triangle, and you will not be penalized or rewarded. Please try to answer all questions to the best of your ability to maximize your score.

Now we will test your ability to answer the questions in the proper manner. You will read prompts on how to answer hypothetical questions about ice cream flavor popularity and then be asked how your score would be affected. You will not be able to move on to the next question until you have answered correctly (but only during this practice session), so pay attention. If you do not understand, please contact the experiment before proceeding. If you encounter any issues, please contact the experimenter.
