You will be emailed a link to complete in 48 hours where you will be tested on all of the words.  You will have 24 hours from that time to complete the experiment.  The final test should only take about 10 minutes.  After completion, you will receive the second SONA credit.  You do NOT have to come into the lab again.  You can complete the second part from any computer with the internet (but do NOT complete on a mobile device). Please do not look up any of the definitions or try to do any studying in the meantime.

Please make sure you have provided your email address to the experimenter or else you will not be able to complete the second part of the experiment.

Please let the experimenter know you are finished.

If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter or contact <a href="mailto:emsparck@ucla.edu">emsparck@ucla.edu</a>.
